        Hey everyone! I went to try food from one of Melbourne's most popular
        bars the other day, and thought of giving it a try since they had a $13
        lunch deal for all items on the menu. We didn't order any drinks as I
        can't drink alcohol but here are the 3 delicious items we ordered that
        day;
      </p>

        alt="Soft shell Crab Slider in yuzu mayo"
      />
      <p>
        First up was the Soft shell crab slider consisting of Tempura Soft Shell
        🦀, Watercress,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuzu" target="_blank"> Yuzu</a>,
        Remoulade, Milk Bun). The soft shell crab tempura was crunchy with juicy
        insides, cooked to perfection. However, it was lacking some seasoning -
        noticeably wasn't given any salt nor other spices. For the 🥛 bun, there
        are other places that use higher quality milk buns, theirs was quite
        standard. The other components were fairly good as they should be but
        did not uplift the dish as a whole making it falls quite average.
      </p>

        alt="Beef short ribs with Mash potatoes"
      />
      <p>
        Next, the Beef Short Rib Braised in Sherry with mash 🥔. I would highly
        recommend this one, definitely gives a bang for your buck 💰. The Beef
        was tender and flavourful - It also slid off the rib very easily!<br />
        The smooth creamy mash potato goes well with the sherry beef juice which
        compliments the beef nicely 👌. Simple and satisfying~
      </p>

        alt="Duck Dish"
      />

      <p>
        Lastly, the Pan Seared Duck Breast with Beetroot pure and Beetroot
        Cooked in Duck Fat, topped with 🍎 & Candied Hazelnut Salad + Duck Jus.
        This one is a hit-or-miss dish for me as I am not a big fan of
        beetroots. Nonetheless, I surely understand the appeal and appreciates
        the techniques used. <br />
        The Duck was juicy, golden brown with crispy skin, the jus made it very
        flavourful✨. Beetroot was cooked and cleaned well, its usual strong
        earthy flavour was mellowed out properly to not overpower the duck. The
        salad added a nice touch of sweetness and when eaten all together it
        created a well-balanced flavour; Fattiness from the duck, crunch &
        freshness of the candied hazelnut apple salad plus the earthy flavour of
        the beetroot, surprisingly blended quite well.
