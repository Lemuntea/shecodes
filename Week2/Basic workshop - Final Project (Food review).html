    <h1>‚Ü∂(/ÔΩÄ‚àá¬¥)œà A visit to Naked for Satan</h1>
    <div class="container">
      <p>
        Hey everyone! I went to try food from one of Melbourne's most popular
        bar the other day, thought of giving it a try since they had a $13 lunch
        deal for all items on the menu. We didn't order any drinks as I can't
        drink alcohol but here are the 3 delicious items we ordered that day;
      </p>

        alt="Soft shell Crab Slider in yuzu mayo"
      />
      <p>
        First up was the Soft shell crab slider consisting of: Tempura Soft
        Shell ü¶Ä, Watercress,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuzu" target="_blank"> Yuzu</a>,
        Remoulade, Milk Bun). The soft shell crab tempura was crunchy with juicy
        insides, cooked to perfection. However, it was lacking some seasoning -
        noticably wasn't given any salt nor other spices. For the ü•õ bun, there
        are other places that uses higher quality milk bun, theirs was quite
        standard. The other components were fairly good as it should be but did
        not uplift the dish as a whole making it falls quite average.
      </p>

        alt="Beef short ribs with Mash potatoes"
      />
      <p>
        Next, the Beef Short Rib Braised in Sherry with mash ü•î. I would highly
        recommend this one, definetly gives a bang for your buck üí∞. Beef was
        tender and flavourful - It also slid of the rib very easily!<br />
        The smooth creamy mash potato goes well with the sherry beef juice which
        compliments the beef nicely üëå. Simple and satisfying~
      </p>

        alt="Duck Dish"
      />

      <p>
        Lastly the Pan Seared Duck Breast with Beetroot pure and Beetroot Cooked
        in Duck Fat, topped with üçé & Candied Hazelnut Salad + Duck Jus. This
        one is a hit or miss dish for me as I am not a big fan of beetroots, but
        my partner loved it! Nonetheless, I definetly understands the appeal and
        appreciates the techniques used. <br />
        Duck was juicy, golden brown with crispy skin‚ú®. Beetroot was cooked and
        cleaned well, its usual strong earthy flavour was mellowed out properly
        to not over power the duck. The salad added a nice touch of sweetness
        and the jus made it mouth watering! When eaten all together it created a
        well balanced flavour; Fattiness from the duck, freshness of the apple,
        a hint of sweet from the candied hazelnut and the earthy falvours of a
        beetroot suprisingly blended well
