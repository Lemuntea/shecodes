    <h1>↶(/｀∇´)ψ A visit to Naked for Satan</h1>
    <p>
      Hey everyone! I went to try food from one of Melbourne's most popular bar
      the other day, thought of giving it a try since they had a $13 lunch deal
      for all items on the menu. We didn't order any drinks as I can't drink
      alcohol but here are the 3 delicious items we ordered that day;

    <p>
      First up was the Soft shell crab slider consisting of: Tempura Soft Shell
      🦀, Watercress, Yuzu, Remoulade, Milk Bun). The soft shell crab tempura
      was crunchy with juicy insides, cooked to perfection. However, it was
      lacking some seasoning - noticably wasn't given any salt nor other spices.
      For the 🥛 bun, there are other places that uses higher quality milk bun,
      theirs was quite standard. The other components were fairly good as it
      should be but did not uplift the dish as a whole making it falls quite
      average.

      Next, the Beef Short Rib Braised in Sherry with mash 🥔. I would highly
      recommend this one, definetly gives a bang for your buck 💰. Beef was
      tender and flavourful - It also slid of the rib very easily!<br />
      The smooth creamy mash potato goes well with the sherry beef juice which
      compliments the beef nicely 👌. Simple and satisfying~

      Lastly the Pan Seared Duck Breast with Beetroot pure and Beetroot Cooked
      in Duck Fat, topped with 🍎 & Candied Hazelnut Salad + Duck Jus. This one
      is a hit or miss dish for me as I am not a big fan of beetroots, but my
      partner loved it! Nonetheless, I definetly understands the appeal and
      appreciates the techniques used. Duck was juicy, golden brown with crispy
      skin✨. Beetroot was coocked and cleaned well, its usual strong earthy
      flavour was mellowed out properly to not over power the duck. The salad
      added a nice touch of sweetness and the jus made it mouth watering! When
      eaten all together it created a well balanced flavour; Fattiness from the
      duck, freshness of the apple, a hint of sweet from the candied hazelnut
      and the earthy falvours of a beetroot suprisingly blended well
